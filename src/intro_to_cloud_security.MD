# Introduction to Cloud Security
## Identify New Possibilities and New Risks for Security
By the end of this training, you should be able to:
- Define how the shift to the cloud has created new possibilities and risks for security
- Differentiate security issues with cloud networking over traditional networking
- Explain the definition of cloud security
- Describe the new possibilities for enhanced security

### On-Premises Security Model
Before we explore cloud security, letâ€™s take a dive into the traditional on-premises security model and its associated risks. You'll explore how security solutions were historically deployed in centralized locations, with a strong emphasis on safeguarding internet access through secure DMZ deployment. 
~ In the past, security solutions were mainly implemented on-premises, with a focus on centralized deployment. Internet access was regarded as a highly controlled resource, and devices were typically situated within a tightly secured and centralized DMZ (demilitarized zone) to regulate internet traffic. Organizations relied on specialized hardware security appliances like firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and other security devices, which were physically housed within data centers or other on-premise facilities.
