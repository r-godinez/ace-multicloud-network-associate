# Introduction to the Aviatrix Cloud Networking Platform


## Alternative Solutions: Harness Aviatrix for Simplified Cloud Networking
By the end of this training, you should be able to:
- Identify the solutions to common CSP limitations
- Outline best practices in cloud security
- Determine methods of cost reduction

Aviatrix addresses the fundamental considerations posed by conventional cloud service providers (CSPs) with a comprehensive platform that simplifies cloud networking, ensuring robust, secure, and efficient operations across multicloud environments.

Cloud service providers (CSPs) often encounter limitations that hinder scalability, security, and efficiency. Aviatrix addresses these challenges by offering a robust cloud networking platform that enhances visibility, control, and performance across multicloud environments. The **Aviatrix system uses a software-defined networking (SDN)** approach, centralizing control through three main software components, Controller and CoPilot platforms, while distributing data operations across Aviatrix Gateways. This structure provides a secure overlay network atop existing CSP infrastructure, ensuring high-performance encryption and comprehensive network management.

We will take a look at some of the key features and how they operate.

### Centralized Control, Orchestration, and Automation Plane
#### Aviatrix Controller
The Aviatrix Controller acts as the central hub or brain of our Multicloud Network Architecture (MCNA), using its control plane logic to seamlessly manage cloud and multicloud networks. 

**The Controller encompasses three important roles**:
- Functions as a Centralized Control Plane by filling up the routing tables of the Aviatrix Gateways
- Acts as a Centralized Orchestration Plane by orchestrating, for instance, an Application Load Balancer in front of a fleet of Aviatrix VPN Gateways
- Serves as a Centralized Automation Plane by ingesting any Terraform manifests.

#### Aviatrix CoPilot
Aviatrix CoPilot™ serves as the sophisticated **management interface** for the Aviatrix Cloud Networking Platform, enhancing visibility across complex, multicloud networks controlled by the Aviatrix Controller.

It provides a comprehensive operational view of your cloud network, crucial for supporting business-critical cloud networking operations. CoPilot empowers enterprises to implement intelligent cloud networking by embedding robust security features alongside advanced monitoring and diagnostic tools that bolster application availability. 

CoPilot delivers insights into cloud networking costs, illustrating how network resources are utilized by different business units or cost centers, which is essential for accurate billing. 
The Aviatrix data plane channels logs, NetFlow data, visibility, telemetry, and control plane traffic to Aviatrix CoPilot™, granting a unified "single pane of glass" view of your secure cloud network. With Aviatrix CoPilot, you gain the ability to configure, manage, automate, and operate all your network connections, security policies, and monitor all gateways and traffic across your network through a user-friendly interface, API, or Terraform.
